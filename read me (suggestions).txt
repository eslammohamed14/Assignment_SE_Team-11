all team member should change functions to take an integr array and return integer array 
not print (return print in main)
execpt function 6 & 9 & 10 
should take char and return char
because if we insert an negetive number or number two digit it will give us errors
like in function 14 we should insert an negetive numbers 
and in function execution we will turn arr int to char for the 3 function (6&9&10)
.........
please do this fast as you can ..
